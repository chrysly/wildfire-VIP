# Wildfire VIP
Wildfire prediction and simulation for VIP with Prof. Bo Zhu and mentor Duowen.

## Training
Run `python3 cnn_train.py`.

This script splits the images in `CandleFire3000-5000K` folder into a training set and a test set. It will use the training set to train a model, which is saved as `candle_temperature_model.h5`. The script also generates a text file `test_set_filenames.txt` that lists the images in the test set for our reference.

## Inference
Run `python3 cnn_inf.py`.

This script runs inference on a list of images from `CandleFire3000-5000K` which were part of the test set. At the bottom of the script, you can modify the `selected_images` list to pick which images you want to run inference on. Make sure they are images in the test set (see `test_set_filenames.txt`, generated by `cnn_train.py`).

You can also uncomment the first few lines in `__main__` to run inference on a *randomly* selected image from the test set.

## Training and Inference Combined
The `cnn_combined_train_inf.py` will train and run inference in one script.
